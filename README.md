2. **pip** (usually comes with Python)
3. **A modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neoproxy.git
cd neoproxy

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup

1. **Start the proxy**:
   ```bash
   python neoproxy_addon.py
   ```

2. **Generate mitmproxy certificate**:
   ```bash
   mitmdump --set confdir=~/.mitmproxy
   ```

3. **Install certificate in your browser**:
   - **Chrome**: Settings → Privacy and Security → Security → Manage Certificates → Import
   - **Firefox**: Settings → Privacy & Security → View Certificates → Import
   - **Edge**: Settings → Privacy, Search, and Services → Security → Manage Certificates → Import

4. **Configure proxy**:
   - **FoxyProxy** (Recommended): Install extension and add proxy with:
     - Host: `127.0.0.1`
     - Port: `8080`
   - **Manual**: Set system proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080`

---

## 🔧 Advanced Setup

### Using FoxyProxy (Recommended)

1. Install [FoxyProxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) extension
2. Add new proxy:
   ```
   Title: Neopets Proxy
   Proxy Type: HTTP
   IP Address: 127.0.0.1
   Port: 8080
   ```
3. Set URL pattern: `*neopets.com*`
4. Enable the proxy

### Manual Browser Configuration

#### Chrome/Edge
```bash
# Start Chrome with proxy
google-chrome --proxy-server="127.0.0.1:8080" --ignore-certificate-errors
```

#### Firefox
```bash
# Start Firefox with proxy
firefox --proxy-server="127.0.0.1:8080"
```

### System-Wide Proxy (All OS)

#### Windows
```cmd
# Set proxy via command line
netsh winhttp set proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Set proxy via command line
networksetup -setwebproxy "Wi-Fi" 127.0.0.1 8080
```

#### Linux
```bash
# Set proxy via environment variables
export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080
export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## 🎮 How It Works

The proxy uses advanced request interception to:

1. **Monitor game pages** and extract game names dynamically
2. **Cache play_flash requests** to prevent duplicate loading
3. **Inject modified SWF files** that fix game-breaking issues
4. **Rewrite URLs** to ensure proper resource loading
5. **Handle host redirections** for optimal performance

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Game Detection**: Automatically identifies games from page content
- **Smart Caching**: Prevents duplicate requests for better performance
- **SWF Injection**: Seamlessly replaces broken game files with fixed versions
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Browser Agnostic**: Compatible with all major browsers

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Certificate Errors**
```bash
# Regenerate certificate
rm -rf ~/.mitmproxy
mitmdump --set confdir=~/.mitmproxy
```

**Proxy Not Working**
- Check if port 8080 is available
- Ensure certificate is properly installed
- Verify proxy settings in browser

**Games Still Broken**
- Clear browser cache
- Restart the proxy
- Check if SWF files are in correct directories
